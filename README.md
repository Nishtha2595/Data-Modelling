# Project: Data Modeling with Postgres

## Purpose of the Project
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.
They'd like a data engineer to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis, and bring you on the project. Your role is to create a database schema and ETL pipeline for this analysis. You'll be able to test your database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare your results with their expected results.

## Project Description
In this project, you'll apply what you've learned on data modeling with Postgres and build an ETL pipeline using Python. To complete the project, you will need to define fact and dimension tables for a star schema for a particular analytic focus, and write an ETL pipeline that transfers data from files in two local directories into these tables in Postgres using Python and SQL.

**Song Dataset**
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset.

song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like:

{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}

**Log Dataset**
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json


## Running the Python Scripts
**At the terminal:

1) python create_tables.py
2) python etl.py

**In IPython:

1) run create_tables.py
2) run etl.py


## Description of Files

### Directory: data/log_data
This directory contains a collection of JSON log files. These files are used to populate our Fact table - Song Plays - and to populate the Dimension tables for Users and Time.

### Directory: data/song_data
This directory contains a collection of Song JSON files. These files are used to populate Dimension tables for Songs and Artists.

### create_tables.py
This Python script recreates the database and tables used to storethe data.

### etl.ipynb
A Python Jupyter Notebook that was used to initially explore the data and test the ETL process.

### etl.py
This Python script reads in the Log and Song data files, processes and inserts data into the database.

### sql_queries.py
A Python script that defines all the SQL statements used by this project.

### test.ipynb
A Python Jupyter Notebook that was used to test that data was loaded properly.


## Justification of database schema design and ETL pipeline
The star schema has 1 fact table (songplays), and 4 dimension tables (users, songs, artists, time). DROP, CREATE, INSERT, and SELECT queries are defined in sql_queries.py. create_tables.py uses functions create_database, drop_tables, and create_tables to create the database sparkifydb and the required tables.

Extract, transform, load processes in etl.py populate the songs and artists tables with data derived from the JSON song files, data/song_data. Processed data derived from the JSON log files, data/log_data, is used to populate time and users tables. A SELECT query collects song and artist id from the songs and artists tables and combines this with log file derived data to populate the songplays fact table.


## Song play example queries
Simple queries might include number of users with each membership level.
SELECT COUNT(level) FROM users;

Day of the week music most frequently listened to.
SELECT COUNT(weekday) FROM time;

Or, hour of the day music most often listened to.
SELECT COUNT(hour) FROM time;
